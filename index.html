        <h3>Welcome to the dotSkapes Virtual Lab.</h3>

<p>The dotSkapes Virtual Lab (dVL) is a collection of tools that fuel our dotSkapes collaborative science platform. We're refactoring and reorganizing since our move to NYC. Through 2013 we'll be updating our interface and adapting components of the project (e.g. our mapping environment, analytical engine, and data repository) to a variety of applied research projects in global health and ecology. </p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>The project was co-founded in 2010 by Nico Preston (<a href="https://github.com/nicopresto" class="user-mention">@nicopresto</a>) and Zack Krejci (<a href="https://github.com/zack-krejci" class="user-mention">@zack-krejci</a>). The lab was an extension of the Healthscapes Project at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE). Nico and Zack are currently employed by EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) in New York City.</p>

<h3>Mentors</h3>

<p>Academic: During Nico's postdoc (SAGE, UW-Madison) and Zack's studies (Computer Sciences, UW-Madison), the Healthscapes prototype was mentored and supported by Dr. Jonathan Patz, other advisors included Dr. Mutlu Ozdogan, Dr. Anne-Marie Schneider, and Dr. Tony Goldberg. </p>

<p>Non-Profit: We are continuing work on the project while employed by EcoHealth Alliance, a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit in Manhattan, NY, with the support of Dr. Peter Daszak (EHA President).</p>

<p>Open Source Community: Early versions of dotSkapes (then Healthscapes) were inspired by collaboration and peer mentoring with the Sahana Software Foundation. We count on the Python software community and PyCon for a regular dose of inspiration.</p>

<p>Informal: Many of our ideas were incubated from discussions with Fran Boon (Sahana Foundation), Jeff Ramnani (DRW Holdings), Matt McCormick (Kitware Inc.), and Josh Danczyk (UW-Madison).</p>
